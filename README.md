# PerfectPace Timer

PerfectPace Timer is an Android application designed to provide structure and discipline for personal weight-loss through a dynamic, Pomodoro-inspired timer. The app empowers you to set flexible work/rest ratios based on real-time input, supporting incremental progress in your daily routine.

## Features

- **Flexible Work Sessions**  
  Work sessions act as a stopwatch with a duration defined by the user. When you initiate a session, the `TimerService` starts the stopwatch immediately, providing a custom-timed work period.

- **Dynamic Break Mode**  
  When you decide to take a break, the app seamlessly switches modes. The stopwatch converts into a countdown timer that starts from the elapsed time of your preceding work session. This switch is managed by setting `isBreakMode` to true and calculating the appropriate `breakDuration` in the `TimerService`.

- **Audio Alerts for Enhanced Time Awareness**  
  Every 30 minutes during a work session, audio alerts remind you to stay mindful of your progress. The `timerRunnable` in `TimerService` checks for multiples of 1800 seconds (30 minutes) and triggers an alert sound.

- **Persistent Background Timer**  
  The core timer continues to run in the background using a persistent foreground service (`TimerService`). This service, declared with a `foregroundServiceType` of `specialUse` in the manifest, ensures continuous operation even when the app isnâ€™t front and center.

- **Modern UI with Jetpack Compose**  
  Leveraging Jetpack Compose, the app presents a clean and responsive UI on a dedicated `TimerScreen`, giving you real-time visual feedback of the current session.

- **Real-Time UI Updates using BroadcastReceiver**  
  The `TimerBroadcastReceiver` listens for time updates sent from the `TimerService` and updates the `currentTime` state in `MainActivity` through a listener interface. This guarantees that your timer display remains accurate and in sync with the service.

- **Direct Service Binding from MainActivity**  
  MainActivity binds to the `TimerService` using a ServiceConnection. This connection empowers you to control timer functionalities directly from the UI, such as starting the stopwatch (`startStopwatch`) or switching to break mode (`switchToBreakMode`).

## Architecture & Key Components

- **TimerService**  
  A foreground service that handles starting, maintaining, and transitioning between work sessions and break periods. It also manages the periodic audio alerts and ensures the timer runs reliably in the background.

- **TimerBroadcastReceiver**  
  This component receives `TIMER_UPDATE` broadcasts from the `TimerService` and refreshes the UI in MainActivity, keeping the displayed time accurate.

- **MainActivity**  
  The primary interface built with Jetpack Compose. It binds to the TimerService to initiate and control timer functions and listens for updates through the TimerBroadcastReceiver.

## Technical Specifications

- **Programming Language**: Kotlin  
- **Target SDK**: Android SDK 35  
- **Minimum SDK**: Android SDK 21  
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose  
- **Build Tool**: Android Gradle Plugin  

## Usage

1. **Start a Work Session**  
   Launch the app and initiate a work session. The stopwatch in `TimerService` will begin timing your flexible work session immediately.

2. **Switch to Break Mode**  
   During a work session, trigger the mode switch to transition into break mode. The countdown will start based on your elapsed work session time, providing a natural break period.

3. **Receive Audio Alerts**  
   Keep track of your progress with audio alerts every 30 minutes, ensuring you remain aware of the passing time during long work sessions.

4. **Background Operation**  
   The persistent foreground service guarantees that your timing continues unabated, even if the app is not visible.
